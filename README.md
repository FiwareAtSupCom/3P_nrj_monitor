# Project Description

## Introduction:
The Three phases Energy analyse and monitor is project that aims to accurately measure and present the digital twin representation of power quantity and quality in three-phase systems. This system leverages the ADE9000 integrated circuit for precise measurements. The data is then transmitted via the ISP interface to an ESP8266, which communicates over Wi-Fi with a FIWARE context broker. The FIWARE context broker is responsible for data storage and communication with Grafana for visualization.

## Project Objectives:
L'objectif central de notre projet est de développer un système de smart metering qui permettra la mesure précise et complète des valeurs quantitatives et qualitatives associées aux systèmes de production et de consommation d'énergie électrique. Contrairement à la focalisation sur le ADE 9000, notre attention est portée sur la création d'un outil innovant et performant qui répondra aux besoins spécifiques liés à la surveillance et à l'optimisation des processus énergétiques.

## Systèmes monitorés:

Le système axé sur la mesure et la surveillance de l'énergie en trois phases, pourrait être utilisé pour surveiller divers systèmes de production et de consommation d'énergie électrique. Voici quelques exemples de systèmes que le système peut monitorer :


1. Réseau Électrique Local : Le système pourrait être utilisé pour surveiller la consommation d'énergie dans un bâtiment, permettant aux utilisateurs de prendre des décisions informées pour économiser de l'énergie.
Le système pourrait surveiller la consommation d'énergie pour l'éclairage, le chauffage, la climatisation, etc., afin d'optimiser l'efficacité énergétique.

2. Systèmes d'Énergie Renouvelable : Il pourrait être utilisé pour surveiller les systèmes de production d'énergie renouvelable tels que les parcs éoliens, les centrales solaires, etc.

### Context Broker (Orion)

The FIWARE Orion Context Broker serves as the central hub for managing context data in our IoT system. It receives requests using the NGSI-v2 standard and handles crucial aspects such as data entities, subscriptions, and registrations.

### MongoDB

MongoDB is employed as the backend for the Orion Context Broker. It plays a pivotal role in storing context data information, managing data entities, and facilitating various operations related to context management.

### QuantumLeap

FIWARE QuantumLeap is a powerful generic enabler designed to simplify the storage and retrieval of time-series data generated by the Orion Context Broker. Unlike the STH-Comet generic enabler, QuantumLeap seamlessly integrates with time-series databases, offering compatibility with databases like CrateDB and TimescaleDB.

### CrateDB

CrateDB serves as a dedicated data sink for our IoT system, with a specific focus on handling time-based historical context data. As a distributed SQL database system tailored for IoT applications, CrateDB excels in ingesting a high volume of data points per second and supports real-time querying. Its capabilities make it well-suited for handling complex queries involving geospatial and time-series data.

Since all interactions between the elements are initiated by HTTP requests, the entities can be containerized and run from exposed ports.
The overall architecture can be seen below:

# Analyzing time series data
Analyzing time series data is crucial for effectively monitoring the three-phase electricity system. The suitability of time series data analysis hinges on the specific requirements of your project and the reliability of the collected measurements. This analytical approach enables you to address key questions related to the electricity system, such as determining the maximum, average, and cumulative measurements of the devices over specific time intervals. Additionally, time series analysis can be applied to mitigate the impact of outliers by employing smoothing techniques, thereby enhancing the overall robustness of the monitoring process.
# Prerequisites
## Docker and Docker Compose

For simplicity, all components will be executed using [Docker](https://www.docker.com), a container technology that facilitates the isolation of different components within their respective environments.
 - To set up Docker on Windows, refer to the provided instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/).
 - For Mac users, the installation steps for Docker can be found[here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/).
 - Linux users can install Docker by following the instructions available [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
 Docker Compose, a tool designed for defining and running multi-container Docker applications, utilizes [YAML files](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiware/tutorials.Time-Series-Data/master/docker-compose.yml)files to configure the necessary services for the application. This approach allows for the simultaneous launch of all container services with a single command. While Docker Compose comes pre-installed with Docker for Windows and Docker for Mac, Linux users may need to refer to the instructions provided [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for installation.
 You can check your current **Docker** and **Docker Compose** versions using the following commands:


```console
docker-compose -v
docker version
```
# Start Up
Prior to initiating the process, it is essential to confirm that you have acquired or constructed the required Docker images on your local system. To do so, kindly clone the repository and generate the essential images by executing the provided commands as follows:
```console
git clone https://github.com/FiwareAtSupCom/3P_nrj_monitor.git
cd 3P_nrj_monitor
git checkout NGSI-v2
```
In this project, we've crafted a Docker Compose file specifically tailored for generating images for Fiware Orion, MongoDB, QuantumLeap, and CreatDB. The docker-compose.yml file serves as a centralized configuration hub, streamlining the orchestration and deployment of these services. By executing the Docker Compose file, you can effortlessly create containers for each component, ensuring a seamless and efficient setup of the required project environment. Please refer to the README instructions for cloning the repository and executing the necessary commands to prepare the essential Docker images for a successful deployment.

We've configured the images for Fiware Orion, ensuring the necessary parameters are optimized. Additionally, we've tailored the configurations for MongoDB images to ensure optimal performance within the project context.
```yaml
orion:
    image: quay.io/fiware/orion:latest
    hostname: orion
    container_name: orion
    depends_on:
        - mongo-db
    networks:
        - default
    expose:
        - '1026'
    ports:
        - '1026:1026'
    command: -dbhost mongo-db -logLevel DEBUG
  ```
  ```yaml
  mongo-db:
    image: mongo:4.2
    hostname: mongo-db
    container_name: db-mongo
    expose:
        - '27017'
    ports:
        - '27017:27017'
    networks:
        - default
  ```
  ### Connecting FIWARE to CrateDB via QuantumLeap

In the configuration, QuantumLeap listens to NGSI v2 notifications on port 8668 and persists historic context data to CrateDB. CrateDB is accessible using port 4200 and can either be queried directly or attached to the Grafana analytics tool.

### CrateDB Database Server Configuration

To set up the CrateDB Database Server, use the following configuration in your docker-compose.yml file:

```yaml
crate-db:
    image: crate:4.1.4
    hostname: crate-db
    ports:
        - '4200:4200'
        - '4300:4300'
    command:
        crate -Clicense.enterprise=false -Cauth.host_based.enabled=false  -Ccluster.name=democluster
        -Chttp.cors.enabled=true -Chttp.cors.allow-origin="*"
    environment:
        - CRATE_HEAP_SIZE=2g
```
If CrateDB exits immediately with a max virtual memory areas vm.max_map_count [65530] is too low, increase to at least [262144] error, this can be fixed by running the sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144 command on the host machine. 
### QuantumLeap Configuration
```yaml
  quantumleap:
    image: smartsdk/quantumleap
    hostname: quantumleap
    ports:
        - '8668:8668'
    depends_on:
        - crate-db
    environment:
        - CRATE_HOST=crate-db
    networks:
      - fiware_network
```  
The quantumleap container is listening on one port:

The Operations for port for QuantumLeap - 8668 is where the service will be listening for notifications from the Orion context broker and where users can query data from.
The CRATE_HOST environment variable defines the location where the data will be persisted.

The cratedb container is listening on two ports:

The Admin UI is available on port 4200
The transport protocol is available on port 4300 
After configuring the docker-compose file, execute it using the following command:
```console 
docker-compose up -d
```
# Système embarqué

L'ESP32 effectue des mesures périodiques via des interruptions de timer. Les données sont transmises par Wi-Fi, et en cas d'interruption de la connexion, l'ESP32 stocke les informations dans une mémoire limitée de 512 octets. Elle surveille activement la connexion Wi-Fi, ajustant les timers pour minimiser le stockage local si la connexion est interrompue. Cette approche garantit une gestion efficace des données malgré les perturbations de la connectivité
